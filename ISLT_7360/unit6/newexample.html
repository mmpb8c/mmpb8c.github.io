<h1>Evaluation of the Plackemeier Blog</h1>

<h2>Evaluation Participants</h2> 

<p>The three people who helped evaluate my website are my sister, bestfriend, and cousin. I really appreciate the time and effort they put into this just to help me. 
 </p>

 <p>The first person to evaluate my website was my sister, Brittany. She has always been there for me growing up so I thought she would be the perfect person to ask help me evaluate my website. Brittany said that her experience evaluating my website was interesting and that she was proud of me for creating what I had so far. When evaluating my website my sister used a MacBook Pro and Safari Version 10.1.2 </p>

 <p>The second person to evaluate my website was my bestfriend and roomate, Vanessa. She personally has never had experience with coding so she helped me by giving me her honest opinion about the looks and layout of the website so far. She had also used a Macbook Pro and used Safari. </p>

 <p>The final person to evaluate my website was my Cousin, Katie. Katie knows a little more about coding than the others do. She knows what coding is and certain things about it, but not all of it. Katie had used a Macbook Air and used Safari as her browser.  </p>

<p>Audience</p>
<p>The audience of this webpage will be young adults, both male and female, still in their 20's who are trying to figure out their role in this world. As a young adult who is about to graduate from college and take on the real world, I am overwhelmed and scared of what is to come. But, very hopeful. Trying to figure out life isn't easy and it never will be but I want to create a website in which young adults can come and relate to the content. Primarily, this website will be a positive environment, in which individuals can be themselves.</p>

<p>Below you will find the list of website resources ulitized as good and bad examples of design:</p>
<ul>
        <li><a href="brittanyevaluation">Evaluation 1</a></li>
        <p>Evaluation one was done by my sister, Brittany. She is 26 years old!</p>
        <li><a href="https://jessicasepel.com">Jessica Sepel Blog</a></li>
        <p>This website provides another good example of content and information that I would like to have 
            on my personal website. The layout is very similar to the one above, but this one includes more 
            information. In order to see all of the information provided, alot of scrolling needs to be provided. </p>
        <li><a href="https://fitfoodiefinds">Fit Foodie Finds</a></li>  
        <p>This website also provides some examples of what I want to include on my webpage. For instance,
            some of the categories are recipes, wellness, and lifestyle. When you load the home page, I like the 
            way this website is laid out. The heading is very simple and clear. The actual home page itself is 
            quite crowded.</p>	
        <li><a href="https://www.rosannadavisonnutrition.com">Rosanna Davison Nutrition</a></li>
       <p>This website is an example of what not to do. This website has great content but the layout is not very attractive and very cluttered.</p> 
        <li><a href="https://www.tedisrah.com">Tedisrah Blog</a></li>
        <p>The final website that I have chosen is another example. I noticed that the website had some flaws. When arriving on the home page, the website seems bland. Adding some color to the website will really pop the website and make it more pleasing to look at as a visitor. Some of the content was locked which was very odd. I want my website to be an open and free environment to anyone whom comes to visit.</p>
      </ul>
