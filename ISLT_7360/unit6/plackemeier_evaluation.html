        <h2>Evaluation Participants</h2> 

  <p>The three people who helped evaluate my website are my sister, bestfriend, and cousin. I really appreciate the time and effort they put into this just to help me.  </p>

<p>Brittany</p>
<p>The first person to evaluate my website was my sister, Brittany. She has always been there for me growing up so I thought she would be the perfect person to ask help me evaluate my website. Brittany said that her experience evaluating my website was interesting and that she was proud of me for creating what I had so far. When evaluating my website my sister used a MacBook Pro and Safari Version 10.1.2 </p>

<p>Vanessa</p>
<p>The second person to evaluate my website was my bestfriend and roomate, Vanessa. She personally has never had experience with coding so she helped me by giving me her honest opinion about the looks and layout of the website so far. She had also used a Macbook Pro and used Safari. </p>

<p>Katie</p>
<p>The final person to evaluate my website was my Cousin, Katie. Katie knows a little more about coding than the others do. She knows what coding is and certain things about it, but not all of it. Katie had used a Macbook Air and used Safari as her browser.  </p>
        
 <h2>Summary of Evaluators' Comments</h2>
        <p>When reviewing the three evaluations, I was very excited about the feedback that I had recieved. Most of the feedback that I recieved was positive, while there are some areas of my blog that need work. According to the evaluations, some of the strengths of my website are the color scheme. My sister Brittany commented and said "I love the colors that you chose. They really bring out your fun and loving personality!" Another strength of my website is Credibility. All three evaluators mentioned that I did a great job establishing credibility by including all my personal information on the website. This includes pictures, email, etc. Some of the weaknesses of my website would have to be the layout of the pictures and some of the content. Some of my pictures are on the left side of the home page where as on the Health and Fitness Page some of my pictures are centered. This can make a website not look as professional. Another weakness when reviewing the evaluations was that I need a specific area on the home page that explains exactly why I made this website. I think putting this on the home screen will help the visitors better understand the exact purpose behind my website and what motivated me to create this blog! </p>

        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p> After recieving the feedback from my evaluators and classmates, I truly believe that my website will support all three of my use cases. All three of my use cases are things that people will easily relate too in today's world, including: Health, Fitness, Mindfullness and Stress. I trust that my website will fulfill its purpose which is to serve as a blog and safe place for young adults, mostly women in their 20's-early 30's who are still trying to figure out their path of life. The driving force behind my website is to inspire young adults to live up to their fullest potential. With the help of others input, I now fully believe that I can support all three of my use cases. </p>
        
        <h2>Recommended/Planned Changes to the Design</h2>
        <p>A few of the changes that I plan on making to my website are:</p>

        <P>General Layout of my website</P>
        <p>This is an area in which I recieved most of my feedback. I realize how important the layout of your website can be. It can sometimes be the make or break factor of a site. With that being said, I will make some changes to the general layout of my website. Both my sister and one of my classmates, Yixiang Gao suggest that I make sure that the layout of my entire website is consistent. Having all pages of your website organized and looking the same makes it way easier for those visiting your website to find what they are looking for much faster and easier. Specifically, I will be moving the photo on my Health and Fitness Page to the left to match the home page!</p>  

        <p>Purpose of the Website</p>
        <p>According to the evaluations, one thing that I need to work on is defining and explaining the purpose of my website to the viewers. In order to fix this, I will put a paragraph on my home page explaining the purpose and driving force behind my website and why I chose to create this blog.</p>
        
       <p>Changes to Navigation</p>
       <p>When reviewing the feedback that I recieved from both my classmates and evaluators, Navigation was another aspect that I was told to work on. My cousin Katie mentioned that she can't tell what page she was on when going through my website. As I realize that this is important to have for your visitors, I plan to create a way in which viewers know what page they are currently on.</p>
        
       <h2>Reflection on Evaluation Process</h2>
        <p>I personally have really enjoyed this part of the course. The evaluation process is very important because it helps ensure that your website is as effective as it should be. This process helps you identify the areas in which your website needs improvement and ultimately helps you realize your goals more effeciently. Having both my classmates and others outside of the class evaluate my website allows me to learn from not only my mistakes but also learn from the mistakes of others. This process has definitely been very beneficial to me because it has made me realize the strengths and weaknesses of my site from people using it on the other end. I believe that nothing is more useful that others honest feedback. I personally chose three people whom don't have much experience with web development and coding because it let me know the outlook of my website from people who would randomly be using it whereas the evaluations made from my classmates helped me more with the layout and overall design of my website. So, this allowed me to have my different perspectives and types of feeback which I really appreciate and find very helpful. </p>
