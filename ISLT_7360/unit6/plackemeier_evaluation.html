<h1>Evaluation of the Plackemeier Blog</h1>

<h2>Evaluation Participants</h2> 

<p>The three people who helped evaluate my website are my sister, bestfriend, and cousin. I really appreciate the time and effort they put into this just to help me.  </p>

<p>The first person to evaluate my website was my sister, Brittany. She has always been there for me growing up so I thought she would be the perfect person to ask help me evaluate my website. Brittany said that her experience evaluating my website was interesting and that she was proud of me for creating what I had so far. When evaluating my website my sister used a MacBook Pro and Safari Version 10.1.2 </p>
        
<p>The second person to evaluate my website was my bestfriend and roomate, Vanessa. She personally has never had experience with coding so she helped me by giving me her honest opinion about the looks and layout of the website so far. She had also used a Macbook Pro and used Safari. </p>
        
<p>The final person to evaluate my website was my Cousin, Katie. Katie knows a little more about coding than the others do. She knows what coding is and certain things about it, but not all of it. Katie had used a Macbook Air and used Safari as her browser.  </p>
        
 <h2>Summary of Evaluators' Comments</h2>
        <p>When reviewing the three evaluations, I was very excited about the feedback that I had recieved. Most of the feedback that I recieved was positive, while there are some areas of my blog that need work. According to the evaluations, some of the strengths of my website are the color scheme. My sister Brittany commented and said "I love the colors that you chose. They really bring out your fun and loving personality!" Another strength of my website is Credibility. All three evaluators mentioned that I did a great job establishing credibility by including all my personal information on the website. This includes pictures, email, etc. Some of the weaknesses of my website would have to be the layout of the pictures and some of the content. Some of my pictures are on the left side of the home page where as on the Health and Fitness Page some of my pictures are centered. This can make a website not look as professional. Another weakness when reviewing the evaluations was that I need a specific area on the home page that explains exactly why I made this website. I think putting this on the home screen will help the visitors better understand the exact purpose behind my website and what motivated me to create this blog! </p>
