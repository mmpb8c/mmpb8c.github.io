<h1>Morgan's Basic Webpage</h1>


<p> Hello, My name is Morgan Plackemeier. Welcome to my basic webpage. On this page, and every other page that
I create within this class, you will get to learn a bit more about me and how I handle certain everyday life situations. I hope that you 
take my advice and it helps you sometime in the future!</p>

<p>In today's world, it is super easy to get stressed. Lately, as I continue to grow older, I can feel myself getting 
stressed out way more than I used to. Stress can cause people major anxiety and sometimes can lead to minor health problems. 
When people get stressed out, they tend to turn to the things that will make them feel better at the moment such as binge eating. 
In this page, I want to share with you a list of ideas and help you ease a little stress today by incorporating these small daily
habits into your daily routine. </p>

<h2>3 Daily Habits to help Relieve Stress</h2>

<h3>1. Practice Gratitude</h3>

<p> Practicing gratitude helps appreciate and be thankful for what we do have rather than what we don't have.
It helps us remember what is truly important. Starting a gratitude journal can be super helpful. Everyday when you wake up
and before you go to bed, write down one thing you are grateful for.</p>

<h3>2. Read A Good Book</h3>

<p> Doing a little bit of light reading before you start your day can inspire you to be the best version of yourself that day. 
Books I highly recommend are both You are a Badass and You are a Badass Everday by Jen Sinero. 

<h3>3. Physical Activity</h3>

<p> Regular physical activity is very important when it comes to living a healthy stress free life. 
As little as 30 minutes a day, whether it is walking, running, lifting, etc. In doing so, this will boost your 
energy levels like crazy, and bring down your stress levels at the same time.
