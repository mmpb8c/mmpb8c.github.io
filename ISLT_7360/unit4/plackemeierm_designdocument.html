<h1>Morgan's Plackemeier's Design Document</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2> 

<p>This website will serve as a blog for young adults, mostly women in their 20's who are still trying to figure out their path of life. The driving force behind my website is to inspire young adults to live up to their fullest potential. From mental health, work life, family and friends, living a healthy life is not easy. It will provide a space for individuals to come and find sources regarding everyday things such as fitness, stress and the importance of happiness. It is important that we as humans know our self-worth and how important we are. This website will provide content that will help young adults feel more confident in everyday life, and will allow them to live the life they have always dreamed of.</p>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>

<p> Weekly, there will be new opportunities to learn new recipes and lifestyle tips as I upload them to the Health & Fitness section of my website. The individual accessing the website may load the home page, click on the Health & Fitness tab within the navigation bar and will then have access to all of the articles and information regarding Health & Fitness. A specific scenario would be if a mother of two kids wants to find a new delicious healthy recipe to cook for her family dinner. She would go to the website and find the home page. Then, proceed to the Health & Fitness tab. Once that page loads, there she will find many different recipes to choose from. There will be links that you can use to download the recipes that will be loaded onto my website.</p>

<p>Stress is a natural part of life. Everybody deals with stress. One may come to my website to find advice on stress and how to cope with it. The individual will load the home page, click on the mindfulness & stress section within the navigation bar. They will then have access to all the information on stress. There will also be downloadable links for the articles containing information about mindfulness and stress. By doing this, it allows for people who are visiting my website to download the information and use it to their advantage. They can either just download it to their computer or they can even download it and print it out so that they can hang it up on their refrigerator as a daily reminder!</p>

<p>On my blog, I will have inspirational quotes of the week. An individual may be having a tough week and may be in need of some inspiration. She/he can easily load the home page of my website and find some quotes that will make them feel inspired and motivated to take on the day ahead of them. </p>

<h2>Design Document</h2>
<p>Audience</p>
<p>The audience of this webpage will be young adults, both male and female, still in their 20's who are trying to figure out their role in this world. As a young adult who is about to graduate from college and take on the real world, I am overwhelmed and scared of what is to come. But, very hopeful. Trying to figure out life isn't easy and it never will be but I want to create a website in which young adults can come and relate to the content. Primarily, this website will be a positive environment, in which individuals can be themselves.</p>

<p>Below you will find the list of website resources ulitized as good and bad examples of design:</p>
<ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.thebalancedblonde.com">The Balanced Blonde</a></li>
        <p>This website provides a good example of ideas regarding content that I want to include on my website.
            I also do like the organization and layout of this website as the design is very simple but unique.</p>
        <li><a href="https://jessicasepel.com">Jessica Sepel Blog</a></li>
        <p>This website provides another good example of content and information that I would like to have 
            on my personal website. The layout is very similar to the one above, but this one includes more 
            information. In order to see all of the information provided, alot of scrolling needs to be provided. </p>
        <li><a href="https://fitfoodiefinds">Fit Foodie Finds</a></li>  
        <p>This website also provides some examples of what I want to include on my webpage. For instance,
            some of the categories are recipes, wellness, and lifestyle. When you load the home page, I like the 
            way this website is laid out. The heading is very simple and clear. The actual home page itself is 
            quite crowded.</p>	
        <li><a href="https://www.rosannadavisonnutrition.com">Rosanna Davison Nutrition</a></li>
       <p>This website is an example of what not to do. This website has great content but the layout is not very attractive and very cluttered.</p> 
        <li><a href="https://www.tedisrah.com">Tedisrah Blog</a></li>
        <p>The final website that I have chosen is another example. I noticed that the website had some flaws. When arriving on the home page, the website seems bland. Adding some color to the website will really pop the website and make it more pleasing to look at as a visitor. Some of the content was locked which was very odd. I want my website to be an open and free environment to anyone whom comes to visit.</p>
      </ul>

<p>In determining whether the blog would be a hit for the intended audience, a survey was given out to 5 young adults. I had 3 people take the survey who were ages 20-25. The other 2 were between ages 26-30. Some of the questions that were asked:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If I were to create a blog that includes information regarding mental health, fitness, and happiness. Would you be interested in it?</li>
        <li>If you are interested, what kind of specific content would you be most excited about?</li>
        <li>How often do you plan on visiting my website?</li>
    </ul>
<p>When the survey results came back, I was excited to see the results! When I took my first glance over the survey's, many of the responses to the first question were the same. 5 out of 5 responded saying yes, they would be very interested. One individual stated "yes, I would love for you to come out with a blog! I feel like I would really enjoy reading your content!" When it came to specific content, 3 out of 5 responded with Health & Fitness. One stating "You have always been so fit and I have always wondered what you do. So, now I will be able to!" Overall, the survey was a good way to bring in some ideas from the outside onto my website.</p>


<h2>Presentation Information</h2>
<p>The website will contain one home page and seperate supporting pages that connect users with the information they are looking for.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Home Pages</li>
    <p>The home page will be the main page where you find all the basic information about the website. This is the page that you will navigate to when you want to see all the information that the website contains. I am hoping to have documents that are links to .pdfs that will open to a new tab. On the home page, you will also find out more about me and why I chose to start this blog!</p>
    <li>Subsequent pages</li>
    <p>These pages will be found in the navigation bar of my website and will provide information pertaining to a specific purpose or individual. As many people may come to my website for several different reasons, it is important to divide and organize these pages for people to easily access what they are looking for. A link back to the homepage will be available on each page. Pages will be set up in list form with links underneath full of information related to the page tab. Hopefully, this will help everyone locate information easily.</p>
    <li>Mindfullness & Stress</li>
    <li>Health & Fitness</li>
</ul>

<h2>Media</h2>
<p>My website will consists of many images. Most of them will be images that were taken by me, while few others will be used that aren't. If I am unable to innovate, I will use common images and cite as justified by the photographer of that image. Pictures will be used in order to improve the data and allow peoople to visually see the concepts rather than just reading them.</p>

<h2>Color Scheme</h2>
<p>The colors in which I am using to build my blog are simply light pink, red, black, white and gray. The background color of all pages of my website will remain white with black content. This will allow readers to be able to read the content easily. The colors that I chose to use to pop my design are red and light pink. I believe these make people happy and loved and that is want I want every visitor of my website to feel.</p>

<p>Below you will find examples of the homepage and what the layout of the subsequent pages will be:</p>

<p>Here is an example of the <a href="https://wireframe.cc/bKt2y7">Home Page Layout</a></p>
<p>Here is an example of the <a href="https://wireframe.cc/1XHfUu">Subsequent Pages Layout</a></p>

<p>What I intend to do with my page layouts is to just keep it simple and easy for the people visiting the website. I think it is important to keep it simple because sometimes a crazy website can drive visitors away. So, I am simply just going to have a header with the blog name "The Plackemeier Blog" on it. Below that you will find the navigation bar in which you will use to get to the various pages of the website. Then under that the Navigation bar you will find the content including all the different pictures and articles found on the website. Lastly, all my pages will end with an updated footer. </p>
