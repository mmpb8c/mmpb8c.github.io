<p>Audience></p>
<p>The audience of this webpage will be young adults, both male and female, still in their 20's who are trying to figure out their role in this world. As a young adult who is about to graduate from college and take on the real world, I am overwhelmed and scared of what is to come. But, very hopeful. Trying to figure out life isn't easy and it never will be but I want to create a website in which young adults can come and relate to the content. Primarily, this website will be a positive environment, in which individuals can be themselves.</p>

<p>Below you will find the list of website resources ulitized as good and bad examples of design:</p>

        <p>This website provides a good example of ideas regarding content that I want to include on my website.
            I also do like the organization and layout of this website as the design is very simple but unique.</p>
        <li><a href="https://jessicasepel.com">Jessica Sepel Blog</a></li>
        <p>This website provides another good example of content and information that I would like to have 
            on my personal website. The layout is very similar to the one above, but this one includes more 
            information. In order to see all of the information provided, alot of scrolling needs to be provided. </p>

        <p>This website also provides some examples of what I want to include on my webpage. For instance,
            some of the categories are recipes, wellness, and lifestyle. When you load the home page, I like the 
            way this website is laid out. The heading is very simple and clear. The actual home page itself is 
            quite crowded.</p>
